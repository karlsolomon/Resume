\section{Skill matrix}
\cvitem{}{}
%% Skill matrix as an alternative to rate one's skills, computer or other.

%% Adjusts width of skill matrix columns.
%% Usage \setcvskillcolumns[<width>][<factor>][<exp_width>]
%% <width>, <exp_width> should be lengths smaller than \textwidth, <factor> needs to be between 0 and 1.
%% Examples:
% \setcvskillcolumns[5em][][]%    adjust first column. Same as \setcvskillcolumns[5em]
% \setcvskillcolumns[][0.45][]%   adjust third (skill) column. Same as \setcvskillcolumns[][0.45]
% \setcvskillcolumns[][][\widthof{``Year''}]%     adjust fourth (years) column.
% \setcvskillcolumns[][0.45][\widthof{``Year''}]%
% \setcvskillcolumns[\widthof{``Languag''}][0.48][]
% \setcvskillcolumns[\widthof{``Languag''}]%

%% Adjusts width of legend columns. Usage \setcvskilllegendcolumns[<width>][<factor>]
%% <factor> needs to be between 0 and 1. <width> should be a length smaller than \textwidth
%% Examples:
% \setcvskilllegendcolumns[][0.45]
% \setcvskilllegendcolumns[\widthof{``Legend''}][0.45]
% \setcvskilllegendcolumns[0ex][0.46]% this is usefull for the banking style

%% Add a legend if you are using \cvskill{<1-5>} command or \cvskillentry
%% Usage \cvskilllegend[*][<post_padding>][<first_level>][<second_level>][<third_level>][<fourth_level>][<fifth_level>]{<name>}
% \cvskilllegend % insert default legend without lines
% \cvskilllegend*[1em]{}% adjust post spacing
% \cvskilllegend*{Legend}%  Alternatively add a description string
%% adjust the legend entries for other languages, here German
% \cvskilllegend[0.2em][Grundkenntnisse][Grundkenntnisse und eigene Erfahrung in Projekten][Umfangreiche Erfahrung in Projekten][Vertiefte Expertenkenntnisse][Experte\,/\,Spezialist]{Legende}

%% Alternative legend style with the first three skill levels in one column
%% Usage \cvskillplainlegend[*][<post_padding>][<first_level>][<second_level>][<third_level>][<fourth_level>][<fifth_level>]{<name>}
% \setcvskilllegendcolumns[][0.6]%  works for classic, casual, banking
% \setcvskilllegendcolumns[][0.55]%  works better for oldstyle and fancy
% \cvskillplainlegend{}
% \cvskillplainlegend[0.2em][Grundkenntnisse][Grundkenntnisse und eigene Erfahrung in Projekten][Umfangreiche Erfahrung in Projekten][Vertiefte Expertenkenntnisse][Experte/Guru]{Legende}

%% Add a head of the skill matrix table with descriptions.
%% Usage \cvskillhead[<post_padding>][<Level>][<Skill>][<Years>][<Comment>]%
\cvskillhead[-0.1em]%   this inserts the standard legend in english and adjust padding
%% Adjust head of the skill matrix for other languages

%% \cvskillentry[*][<post_padding>]{<skill_cathegory>}{<0-5>}{<skill_name>}{<years_of_experience>}{<comment>}%

I hope this finds you well. Thank you for considering me for the Firmeware Engineer role on your team. Etched seems like an amazing place to work with a very interesting project. I wanted to quickly thank Ericka for her persistance in reaching out to me.

As you'll notice, I've had a work gap over the past $2\frac{1}{2}$ years. This was due to a sudden onset of OCD. After some time at Nvidia, OCD inhibited my work there and eventually led to my termination. At the time I did not know what the issue was. After bouncing around to different mental health professionals with limited progress I was diagnosed with OCD in February 2024. I have been receiving treatment multiple times per week in Phoenix, AZ since the diagnosis. I have come to understand that OCD is hereditary and developed as a complication of starting a new fully-remote job during the pandemic. Since February my treatment has shown significant improvement on my ability to work and live in accordance with my values in spite of having OCD. As a result I have resumed job-seeking and will be moving back to San Jose in January 2025.

How does this impact my efficacy as an employee? This mainly means that I have become more aware of culture fits that work for me and those which don't. Specifically I perform best when I get to collaborate closely with others, when I am not fully remote, and when my manager/coworkers are willing to make time to hear me out should I have questions/concerns. Under these circumstances I am highly motivated and confident in my ability to perform the job well. Should these conditions be impossible to meet then I am probably not the right candidate for your team.

I have continued to write code and take online courses since leaving Nvidia, specifically . The most involved of which is an ultra-light GPS tracker for backpacking. However, as I highly value honesty and do not want to misrepresent myself, I am definitely rusty relative to when I was while working full time. Should you have any questions about this or anything else I am happy to entertain them at any time.

With all that being said, I appreciate your consideration for this role and look forward to your reply.
